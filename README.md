| Pros | Cons |
|------------|-------------|
| Advanced UI customization (like iconify) | Your device is more prone to brick if not careful |
| Advanced audio manipulation (like ViPER4Android) | but the app is still in development |
| run game cheating software for unlimited gems,diamonds,money, and tokens (like GameGuardian) | Your account may get banned if you got caught cheating |
| Have whatsapp on god power like view deleted messages and more | You may not be able to log in to your whatsapp account as a primary phone |
| Install any app with system level privileges | rooting may make your phone is more vulnerable to be hacked |
